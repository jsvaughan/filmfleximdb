A java project with eclipse project configuration; something I wrote as a first attempt to use Appengine.  Uses Guice.  You'll need the appengine plugin for eclipse if you want to use it.  Also uses jcache; GAE is a bit slow at serving up an app that doesn't get called that often, so the app doesn't query when the page is visited to speed that up a bit.  Note the very fragile parsing of both ff and imdb and various other parts that are lacking professionality before making any use of the code yourself!
